    """A story beat is a shift in the narrative. Story beats can be emotional turns, incidents or events, actions, and reactions, or realizations. 
They can even be small shifts in narrative tone or a characterâ€™s emotional arc. 
Essentially, beats are small moments that move the story forward. Scenes are made up of many beats. Some may be obvious, while others are much more subtle
